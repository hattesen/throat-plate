## Design questions for manufacturability and cost

* Floor fillets in pockets
  * Do they add cost if a _Bull Nose End Mill_ is used and its radius matches the floor fillet?
  * Should the design include fillets, or _Bull Nose End Mill_ be specified separately for the pockets.
* Undercutting / T-Slot
  * What are the standard diameters, height and "reach" of the T-Slot mills?
* Drill holes in sides of 10 mm plate.
  * Does the object need to be mounted vertically? Cost?
* Chamfering bottom edge of object.
  * Does the object (sheet) need to be turned, or can a fillet be made using a dovetail mill?
